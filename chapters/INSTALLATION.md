### Verifying Your Installation

Check out [this webpage](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/verify-install/) for ways to verify your installation worked correctly.

An easy way to test this is through your terminal/command prompt.
1. Make sure you quit your terminal / command prompt application
2. (Re)open it
3. Run `conda --version`

You should see a version number!

Additionally, you should now have an application called Anaconda Navigator.
If that application exists, you installed successfully.
